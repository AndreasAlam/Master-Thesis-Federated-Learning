# Federated Learning Used to Detect Credit Card Fraud

Credit card fraud is a problem for consumers and banks all over the world, thus, an effective Fraud Detection System (FDS) is important. Commonly, FDS are built by using machine learning algorithms and to get a well performing model a large dataset is required. Though, due to the skewness of credit card transaction datasets as well as the security and privacy attached to them a centralised FDS is not the best suited approach. Instead, we propose an FDS trained with federated learning, a machine learning setting where multiple entities collaborate under the coordination of a central server. With this approach banks can get benefits of a shared model, which has seen more fraud than each bank alone, without sharing their datasets. Results in our thesis indicates that Federated Averaging can perform and outperform the Multi Layer Perceptron when detecting credit card fraud.

The credit card transaction dataset used in this project has over 280k real transactions which are all made in Europe in September 2013 and is obtained from Kaggle, [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). The dataset has been modified into three different settings and are used for training, validation and testing for both Multi Layer Perceptron as well as for Federated Averaging. These three settings are:
1. Skewed data
2. Non Idenpendent Identically Distruibuted (non-IID) data 
3. SMOTE non-IID data

In (2) and (3) the dataset has been split into non-IID by ordering the transactions according to its timeline and then split the ordered dataset into training, validation and test datasets. In (3) the dataset has been oversampled by applying Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). 

The federated model, Federated Averaging, is built upon
the article [Communication-Efficient Learning of Deep Networks from Decentralized Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.05629.pdf).

This project was done as part of a Master Thesis Project in Machine Learning, Spring 2020, at Lund Technical University and in collaboration with IBM, Kista. The full report can be found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/gkpckjnqntpp).
